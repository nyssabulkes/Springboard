    "# Examining Racial Discrimination in the US Job Market\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "Racial discrimination continues to be pervasive in cultures throughout the world. Researchers examined the level of racial discrimination in the United States labor market by randomly assigning identical résumés to black-sounding or white-sounding names and observing the impact on requests for interviews from employers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "In the dataset provided, each row represents a resume. The 'race' column has two values, 'b' and 'w', indicating black-sounding and white-sounding. The column 'call' has two values, 1 and 0, indicating whether the resume received a call from employers or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the 'b' and 'w' values in race are assigned randomly to the resumes when presented to the employer."

Or, put in other words, blacks had a significantly lower frequency of callbacks within this dataset than whites. \n",

    "No; if you look at the information provided alongside this dataset, there are other factors documented. While we can say with a certain level of confidence that race/name is an influential factor on callback success, there are potentially other significant factors that we haven't explored here. For example, we know that resumes were also sent out based on quality (with a high- and a low-quality resume sent out for each name). That would be a meaningful next step in determining what factors, generally, impact callback rate. In sum, while race/name may be a significant factor, we cannot make any other claims about other factors as we have not tested them."
